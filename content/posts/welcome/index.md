I've been meaning to start my own blog but something about it always seemed intimidating.

In 2017, I read William Zinsser's wonderful book called: <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Writing-Learn-Write-Clearly-Subject-ebook/dp/B00BOQEBFE/" target="_blank">Writing to Learn!</a> with the hope that it would teach me how to write eloquently.

> “Probably no subject is too hard if people take the trouble to think and write and read clearly.” 
> 
> **― William Knowlton Zinsser, Writing to Learn**

Three years have passed since then. And here we are now.
